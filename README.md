# Murder Mystery
## About the game
Murder Mystery is a multimodal game based on speech recognition. The objective of the game is to solve the mysterious murder of Albert Adams, 
who was found killed in his library at his own gathering. You (the player) will pose as a detective, interviewing different 
suspects one by one. By eliminating and deducting clues given by the different suspects, you will be able to guess who the murder is. 

You win by identifying who the murderer is. 
You lose if you identify the wrong person as the murderer.
